## about

I do a lot of hardware hacking, librebooting, radio-hacking. I have a fondness
for old hardware/computers. In researching them I learn more about how computers
really work which is a tough process when everyting is one abstraction layer on
top of another nowadays. Formative experience with the C64 has led me on a path of
embedded systems where memory and processing restrictions are still in place.

Projects are listed below but these are not very active anymore, the real projects
are contained in private repos until the prototypes are finsihsed.

## Projects

### emu6502
With the ambition of learning the semantics of cpp, I started creating an 8-bit
CPU emulator using the 6502 instruction set with 64kb of addressable memory. It
is a long way off from finishing, and when I have time will be most converted
to a pure C program.

### qdws
The quick and dirty web scraper, this is what happens wen you want to make a
very simple web scraper. most useless tool out there.

### J U N KE R((S))
2D platforming engine written in C utilising SDL2, far from finished, the art
takes me a while to complete, working on an accompanying short story to flesh out
the universe. Coming when it's ready.
